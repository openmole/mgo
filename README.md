MGO
===

MGO is a scala library based on the cake pattern for multi-objective evolutionary / genetic algorithms:
* enforcing immutability,
* exposes a modular and extensible architecture,
* implements state of the art algorithms,
* take advantage of multi-core architectures.

MGO implements NGSAII, SMSEMOEA, CMAES and other diversity based evolutionary algorithms.

Example
-------

Define a problem, for instance ZDT4:

```scala

MGO is being refactored

```

Define the optimisation algorithm, for instance NSGAII:

```scala

MGO is being refactored

```

Run the optimisation:

```scala

MGO is being refactored

```

For more examples, have a look at the main/scala/fr/iscpif/mgo/test directory in the repository.
